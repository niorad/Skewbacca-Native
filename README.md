# Skewbacca-Native

I get lots of photos of Laptop-Lids for DevLids.com.
Mostly the Lids are not straight on the photo, but somehow distorted.
This app should help me to quickly correct the perspective on those images and do basic color-adjustments, without needing to use more complex tools.
It's my first Mac-App and my first time using Swift > 2, so this is almost certainy not elegant code.

I already did an Electron-Version => https://github.com/niorad/Skewbacca
It works fine, but I'm unhappy with the ImageMagick-Dependency and would like to have a truly native app.
